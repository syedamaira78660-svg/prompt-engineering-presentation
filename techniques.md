### 1. Standard Prompting

Standard prompting is the simplest way to interact with an AI model.

``` text
Create a prompt library application that lets users save and delete prompts.

Users should be able to:
- Enter a title and content for their prompt
- Save it to localStorage
- See all their saved prompts displayed on the page
- Delete prompts they no longer need

Make it look clean and professional with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting provides detailed instructions without examples.

``` test
Create a prompt library application in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Create an HTML page with a form containing fields for the prompt title and content

Add a save prompt button that saves to localStorage

Display saved prompts in cards

Each prompt card should show the title, a content preview of a few words, and a delete button

Deleting should remove the prompt from localStorage and update the display

Style it with CSS to look clean and modern with a developer theme

Include all HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality in their own files, but that can be run immediately and includes no other features.
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. One-Shot Prompting

Provide exactly one example before the actual task.
Note:

choose your example carefully because it sets the pattern
make your example the majority representative, don't pick an edge case
include all elements you want in your output
combine with explicit instructions for any additionally needed clarity
don't overcomplicate your example to cover every case, the model will generalize that pattern

``` text
Write an engaging introduction for a blog post about remote work productivity.

Example:
Topic: Benefits of morning exercise
Introduction: "Picture this: It's 6 AM, your alarm goes off, and instead of hitting snooze, you lace up your sneakers. Sound impossible? Here's the thing—those who exercise before breakfast report 23% higher energy levels throughout their workday. But the real secret isn't just the exercise itself; it's what happens to your brain chemistry in those precious morning hours."

Now write an introduction for: Remote work productivity tips
```
Something we can add to our prompt library is a rating feature, with stars from 1-5. Here is an example of a one-shot prompt to get the model to design that new feature:

Note: you will likely need to prompt the model again to build the feature after sending this prompt. This prompt uses an example to help the model "architect" this feature. Go through what it wants to build, prompt to make any adjustments you see fit, and then prompt the model to "build this feature" (or however you want to word it!)

``` text
You are helping develop a prompt library application. Here's an example of how to analyze and implement a new feature:

**EXAMPLE:** Feature Request: "Add a favorites/bookmarking system"

Implementation Plan:

1. **User Story**: As a user, I want to mark prompts as favorites so I can quickly access my most-used prompts without scrolling through the entire library.
2. **Technical Requirements**:
    - Add a heart/bookmark icon to each prompt card
    - Store favorite status in localStorage or database
    - Create a filter to show only favorited prompts
    - Visual indicator when a prompt is favorited (filled vs outlined icon)
3. **Code Structure**:

javascript
// Data model update
prompt = {
  id: 'prompt-123',
  title: 'Marketing Email Generator',
  content: '...',
  isFavorite: false,  // New field
  createdAt: '2024-01-15',
  rating: 4.5
}

// Toggle favorite function
function toggleFavorite(promptId) {
  const prompt = prompts.find(p => p.id === promptId);
  prompt.isFavorite = !prompt.isFavorite;
  saveToStorage(prompts);
  updateUI();
}

4. **UI/UX Considerations**:
    - Place favorite icon in consistent location (top-right of card)
    - Use intuitive icons (heart or star)
    - Provide visual feedback on click (animation/color change)
    - Add "Favorites" filter tab in navigation

---

**YOUR TASK:** Analyze the following feature request using the EXACT same format as the example above (User Story, Technical Requirements with bullet points, Code Structure with JavaScript examples, and UI/UX Considerations).

Feature Request: "Add a 5-star rating component to rate prompt effectiveness"
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Few-Shot Prompting

Provide multiple examples so the model learns the desired pattern.

Note:

diversity in examples matters
include edge cases and failure cases
keep examples concise but complete
test in a few different chats with a few different number of examples to find what works best

``` text
I need you to create a prompt for implementing a new feature. Here are examples of effective feature implementation prompts:

**EXAMPLE 1: Save/Delete Functionality Prompt**
Create a save and delete system for a prompt library application with the following requirements:

Technical Specifications:
- Save button that persists prompts to localStorage
- Delete button with confirmation dialog before removal
- Visual feedback on successful save (green checkmark animation)
- Trash icon with hover effect for delete action
- Auto-save indicator when changes are detected

Provide complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with:
1. Semantic HTML with data attributes for prompt IDs
2. CSS animations for save confirmation and delete hover states
3. JavaScript with proper event delegation for dynamically added prompts
4. localStorage integration with JSON serialization

The system should work with this data structure:
const prompts = [
  { id: 'prompt-001', title: "Blog Writer", content: "Generate blog posts...", savedAt: Date.now() }
];

Include error handling for localStorage quota exceeded and implement a "Recently Deleted" temporary storage (up to 5 items).

**EXAMPLE 2: Star Rating Component Prompt**
Build a 5-star rating system for rating prompt effectiveness with these specifications:

Core Requirements:
- Interactive 5-star display (click to rate, hover to preview)
- Half-star precision (4.5 stars possible)
- Shows average rating and total number of ratings
- Updates immediately without page refresh
- Allows users to change their rating

Implementation Details:
- SVG stars for crisp display at any size
- Gold fill for rated, gray outline for unrated
- Smooth hover animations (scale and glow effect)
- Display format: "4.5 ★ (23 ratings)"

Deliver production-ready code including:
1. HTML with accessible ARIA labels for screen readers
2. CSS with star animations and responsive sizing
3. JavaScript for rating logic and state management
4. Comments explaining calculation methods

Data model to support:
{
  promptId: 'prompt-001',
  ratings: [5, 4, 5, 3, 5], // Array of all ratings
  userRating: 4, // Current user's rating
  averageRating: 4.4
}

**YOUR TASK:** Based on the examples above, create a detailed prompt for building a "notes section" feature where users can add, edit, save, and delete notes for each prompt in the library.

The prompt should follow the pattern shown in the examples:

- Clear feature description
- Specific technical requirements
- Implementation details
- Expected deliverables
- Data structure/integration notes

Keep it as simple as possible to create a working notes section with only the features mentioned in your task.
```
